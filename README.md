# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Project Overview: Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning 🧠 Objective: To build a machine learning model that can predict future stock prices based on historical stock market data. 
Problem Statement:
Stock prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, and predicting them accurately is challenging. Traditional methods may not capture patterns and anomalies. This project uses machine learning to analyze past data and forecast future stock prices.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used:
Python

yFinance – for fetching historical stock data

Pandas, NumPy – for data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization

Scikit-learn – for machine learning modeling (e.g., Linear Regression)

📊 Dataset:
Historical stock market data is fetched using the Yahoo Finance API through the yfinance Python package. The dataset typically includes:

Date

Open, High, Low, Close prices

Volume

🔍 Approach:
Data Collection – Fetch historical stock data using yfinance.

Data Preprocessing – Clean, visualize, and prepare the dataset.

Feature Engineering – Use the 'Close' price and create a future target column by shifting data (e.g., 30 days ahead).

Model Building – Train a machine learning model like Linear Regression.

Evaluation – Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

Prediction – Predict the stock price for the next 30 days.

Visualization – Plot historical and predicted values.

✅ Outcomes:
Forecasts short-term stock prices based on historical trends.

Evaluates model performance with error metrics.

Provides visual insights for better understanding of predictions.

🔮 Future Enhancements:
Use deep learning models like LSTM for better time-series predictions.

Add Streamlit dashboard for real-time interactive predictions.

Integrate sentiment analysis from financial news or Twitter data.

Include other features like trading volume, moving averages, and macroeconomic indicators.
